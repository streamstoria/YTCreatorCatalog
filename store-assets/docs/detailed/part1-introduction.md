# YouTube Creator Catalog: A Better Way to Organize Your Favorite Channels

In today's vast landscape of YouTube content, keeping track of interesting channels can be overwhelming. Whether you're a content creator, researcher, or simply an enthusiast, the YT Creator Catalog extension transforms how you organize and monitor YouTube channels that matter to you.

## What is YT Creator Catalog?

YT Creator Catalog is a Chrome extension that brings order to your YouTube channel discoveries. Think of it as your personal YouTube channel database, where you can not only bookmark channels but also add custom tags, notes, and track their growth over time. Unlike YouTube's built-in subscription system, this extension focuses on giving you detailed insights and organizational tools for channels you want to monitor closely.

The extension seamlessly integrates with YouTube's interface, adding a simple "Bookmark" button to channel pages. When you bookmark a channel, the extension automatically collects important statistics like subscriber count, total views, and video count. It also keeps track of the channel's most popular videos, giving you a comprehensive overview of their content and performance.

## Key Features That Make a Difference

The extension shines in how it helps you maintain an organized catalog of channels. When you bookmark a channel, you can:

Create meaningful categorizations using custom tags. Whether you're tracking competitors, finding inspiration, or researching your niche, tags help you group channels in ways that make sense for your needs. You might tag channels based on their content type, quality, target audience, or any other criteria that helps you stay organized.

Write detailed notes about channels, capturing your thoughts, observations, and reasons for bookmarking. These notes become a valuable resource when you're reviewing your collection later, helping you remember why each channel caught your attention.

Monitor channel growth and performance through automatically tracked statistics. The extension captures subscriber counts, view totals, and video counts, allowing you to observe trends and changes over time.

Access everything through a dedicated management dashboard where you can effortlessly sort, filter, and search through your bookmarked channels. This makes it easy to find exactly what you're looking for, even as your collection grows.
