# YT Creator Catalog

Lets develop a chrome extension where the user can bookmark youtube channels. The user should be able to click a button on the channel home page, that opens a UI where the user can add tags, notes and save to bookmark. The extension  will collect the stats about the channel from the page itself including a list of top 10 popular videos. Then save it locally. The extension will provide a page where the user can list the bookmarked channels, sort and search by different attributes etc


We can use TailwindCSS for styling and vue3 for dynamic UI. Use Typescript by default.
